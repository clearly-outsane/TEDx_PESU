        <h3>Key takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            With regard to Ocean Conservation, the issues that occur locally in
            India are not greatly highlighted by mainstream media. The content
            we rely on is far too distant from the actual problemâ€™s landscape.
            We should try to go as much in-depth as possible ourselves, digging
            into these issues to find the root cause of these problems.
          </li>
          <li>
            Every door is made available with the advent of the internet, it
            just waits to be knocked on. We have to learn to put ourselves out
            there, and help in any way possible. People will only respond if we
            reach out to them, if not one there are hundreds of others waiting.
          </li>
          <li>
            If there exists a problem, chances are that people are already
            solving it, because these problems are not new. We should go out in
            search of these innovators and utilise their support to make a
            greater impact.
          </li>
          <li>
            As humans, there is no hard and fast rule that we should work only
            on one specific aspect of fulfilment at a time. We can work towards
            our philanthropic goals while simultaneously building our careers in
            other spheres of life.
          </li>
          <li>
            Solving problems begins one step at a time. No matter how small that
            initial step may be, it must be taken to begin the long process of
            saving the environment in our own ways.
