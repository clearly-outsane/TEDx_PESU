        <h2>How Plants and Animals Are Evolving in Cities</h2>
        <h3>Key takeaways</h3>

          <li>
            Evolution and change are terms that cannot be used interchangeably.
            Evolution corresponds to modifications in genes that lead to
            adaptations. An evolutionary adaptation may be referred to as a
            change but not vice versa.
          </li>

            Many argue that the conservation of nature and wildlife is more
            important than citification. However, a balance must be maintained
            between both in order for development to take place. Co-living is
            essential for a sustainable ecosystem.
          </li>

            Survival of the fittest and the rate of adaptation is correlated. If
            one species is more responsive to change than the others, it tends
            to evolve more rapidly. Not all species can evolve at the same pace,
            which explains why the fittest species survive

            Food for thought: We currently live in cities where humans populate
            most of the land and there exist only pockets of green jungles. What
            if humans were to live in pockets of urban development and the rest
            of the land was covered by jungles?

            Some of Darwin’s quotes can be discredited as discussed in the
            video. This gives room for many theories that hold true now to be
            discredited in the future. However, we must not forget that Darwin’s
            theories and ideologies have been major contributors to the field of
            Evolutionary biology.
