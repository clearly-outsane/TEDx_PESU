            Identify the socio-economic impacts of development projects and
            subsidise those which reap positive dividends for the environment.
          </li>
          <li>
            Interactions with rural communities, who are more empathetic towards
            natural resource management, reinforces the importance of the things
            we take for granted.
          </li>
          <li>
            Nature is interconnected, a greater focus on one ecosystem may lead
            to the downslide of another and render the systems incompatible.
          </li>
          <li>
            Equitious distribution must be ensured when an essential resource,
            say water, is priced. It is a common property and must not be
            overused by any individual.
          </li>

            There will be a time when a glass of water will be as valuable as a
            diamond.
