        <h2>Why Renewables Cannot Save The Planet</h2>
        <h3>Key takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Currently, 4% of the electricity in the world comes from nuclear
            sources. If this were to be scaled up to 100%, the entire source of
            nuclear power would diminish within 10-15 years. In order to get
            inexhaustible nuclear power, we would have to harness nuclear energy
            from the isotopes of uranium and thorium in the oceans and seas.
          </li>
          <li>
            The cost of renewable energy sources has drastically fallen down
            from Rs25 per unit to Rs2.5 per unit proving that renewable energy
            sources can be economically efficient.
          </li>
          <li>
            The process of energy generation can never be achieved by a single
            source, we always require a combination of different sources to
            successfully generate electricity for different purposes,ie, nuclear
            or renewable energy alone is not the answer to any of the problems,
            we must use a combination of both.
          </li>
          <li>
            The whole point of discovering new energy sources is to go from
            dilute to concentrated energy and to satisfy the need and greed of
            the community. Hence, we must continue striving for better ways to
            produce electricity and never discard any possible discovery.
          </li>
          <li>
            Transport of solar power should be made possible between countries
            so that none of the energy goes wasted and it would result in the
            economic benefit of all the countries involved.s.
