            A green business functions in the best interests of the local and
            global environment, one that will be resilient and will thrive in
            the long term centring around the idea of saving our planet from any
            further harm. Companies can make a difference to climate change,
            irrespective of their scale of operation, by implementing
            sustainable practices.

            The slogan “small actions can make a big difference” is more
            relevant now than ever. Making small changes in our lifestyle,
            repudiating consumerism and accepting sustainable practices in our
            daily life can make a colossal difference to the planet.

            Major tech giants are setting up goals to go carbon neutral over the
            next decade as a part of a larger goal outlined in the Paris Climate
            Agreement. Governments throughout the world understand the pressing
            existential threat posed by global warming, investing significant
            resources and expertise to switch to more sustainable and ecological
            models.

            Nations with manufacturing prowess need to take bold legislative
            action, invest more in research and development to cut down on their
            emissions and promote a more sustainable approach to manufacturing
            and energy consumption by aiming to switch to greener technologies
            and infrastructural development
